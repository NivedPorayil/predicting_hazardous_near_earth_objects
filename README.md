# Predicting Hazardous Near-Earth Objects Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Introduction
Can AI Predict the Next Asteroid Threat? 🤖  
Recently, the discovery of **Asteroid 2024 YR4** sent shockwaves through the scientific community. While NASA confirmed that it poses no immediate threat, its detection reignited concerns about **Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)** that could potentially collide with our planet 🌍

Using real asteroid trajectory data, I built a **machine learning model** that analyzes key characteristics of NEOs—such as **size, velocity, and distance from Earth**—to predict whether an asteroid is **hazardous or not**.

## 📊 Project Overview
### 🔍 What's Inside This Project?
✅ **Data Exploration**: Understanding asteroid properties and their relationship with impact risk  
✅ **Feature Engineering**: Handling class imbalance, outliers, and rescaling features  
✅ **Model Training**: Comparing **Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression**  
✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Improving model performance  
✅ **Final Evaluation and Insights**

### 📊 Key Findings:
🔹 **Feature importance analysis** revealed that **distance from Earth and relative velocity** play a crucial role in hazard prediction.  
🔹 The **Random Forest model** performed best with an **overall accuracy of 92%**, making it a reliable tool for asteroid classification.  
🔹 **Oversampling techniques** were used to balance the dataset. Proper **handling of outliers** and **tuning the hyperparameters** improved the overall accuracy to **94%** and the **Recall value for hazardous objects to 97%**.

## 🚀 Why Does This Matter?
Asteroid detection and classification are critical for **planetary defense**. With **AI and machine learning**, we can improve early warning systems and help scientists prioritize which objects to monitor closely!

## 💡 Future Scope
This idea can be further enhanced by incorporating **real-time asteroid tracking data** and improving the model's accuracy using advanced **ensemble techniques**.

## 📂 Dataset Source
The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle - [NASA's Near-Earth Objects](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects/code?datasetId=2272878&sortBy=voteCount)**.
